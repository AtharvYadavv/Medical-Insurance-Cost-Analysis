# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Analysis
Project Analysis Summary: Medical Insurance Cost Analysis

In this project, I analyzed the Medical Insurance Cost dataset, which contains demographic and health-related information of individuals such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, region, and medical insurance charges. The main objective was to explore patterns and relationships between personal/health factors and the insurance cost, as well as to build insights for cost prediction.

Steps Performed:

Data Exploration & Cleaning

Checked dataset size, column types, and missing values.

Verified unique categories in categorical variables (sex, smoker, region).

Ensured data consistency and removed anomalies if present.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate analysis: Distribution of charges, age groups, and BMI categories.

Bivariate analysis:

Smokers had significantly higher insurance costs than non-smokers.

BMI positively correlated with charges, especially in overweight individuals.

Age showed a linear increase in charges, with older people paying more.

Categorical analysis: Regional differences were minimal, while gender had less effect compared to smoking and BMI.

Correlation Analysis

Found strong correlation between insurance cost and factors like smoking, age, and BMI.

Weak correlation with gender and region, showing these factors are less influential.

Modeling (if included)

Applied Linear Regression and/or Machine Learning models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.) to predict charges.

Models confirmed that smoking status, age, and BMI are the strongest predictors of insurance costs.

Key Insights:

Smoking is the most significant factor, drastically increasing medical insurance charges.

Age and BMI also play a major role in cost variation.

Gender and region have minimal influence on charges.

Predictive modeling can reasonably estimate insurance charges based on these variables.

Conclusion:

The analysis demonstrates that lifestyle and health choices (like smoking and obesity) have a direct financial impact on medical insurance costs. Insurers can use this information for fairer premium calculations, and individuals can understand how their habits influence costs.
